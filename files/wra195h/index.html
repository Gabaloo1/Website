                          It all started with a “Wait, what?”. Already in college, it struck me to realize I
                          couldn’t figure how would I belong to my field without knowing it, without even being
                          at MSU! Fortunately, WRA 195H helped me explore, immerse, and deepen in the area I desire
                          to pursue: Computer Science. Here’s how.

                        To belong, I first needed to identify what I already possess.
                        I realized that even the most mundane hobbies or passions could
                        contribute to my scholarly success in unimaginable ways.<br>
                        Skating? Drawing? Equitation?
                        I learned from my peers how each of these activities impacted
                        their life and, most importantly, how did they contribute
                        to their scholarly success and boosted their literacy skills
                        (reading, writing, researching).

                        I decided to explore my passionate interest in languages.
                        As a non-English speaker, I've come to acknowledge the value
                        and importance of the world's tongues. I speak Spanish and adventured with Mandarin
                        some years ago. I consider myself an amateur in Japanese, French, and Quechua. <br>
                        I ended up learning that, indeed, my interest in languages profoundly
                        benefitted the way I saw the world through reading, changed the essence
                        of my writing, and enriched my pursue of researching.

                            After performing the research, I concluded that investigation in AI mainly
                            aims to (1) improve the application of a certain feature or (2) create new features for known or unkown applications.

                            AI research is directed to enhancing and developing new algorithms or applications of features that
                            could then be useful in the technological and commercial areas. Therefore, we could say that knowledge
                            in the field is developed and created upon existent knowledge, AI is a growing and permanently evolving field,
                            thus existent practices, even those considered state-of-the-art, are prone to be improved.

                            In order to conduct such a specific type of investigation, academics in the AI field must involve in
                            more narrowed-down secondary research. Throughout the articles analyzed, the authors include several references
                            to previous models related by extracting useful features to rescue and flaws to improve.

                            Ultimately, these research articles are published in journals of the AI field so they are shared in the academia
                            and can be eventually applied to the real-world.

                          Along with Juan, Joanna, Matthew, and Chandan, we designed an engaging presentation in which we
                          gathered our findings of Computer Science and displayed them to everyone aiming
                          to spark interest in our area.
